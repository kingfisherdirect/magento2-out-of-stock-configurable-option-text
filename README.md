# Out Of Stock Configurable Option Text

> Adds text next to the names of the options that are out of stock for configurabe products

Features:

* By default out of stock options are simply greyed out which is unclear and can be confusing, this module adds "Out Of Stock" string after the option name. 

## Installation

` composer require kingfisherdirect/magento2-out-of-stock-configurable-option-text `

## Usage

The "Out Of Stock" message can be changed by going to ` view/frontend/web/js/configurable-oos-label.js ` and changing the "Out Of Stock" string on line 12 (you will also have to change any necessary translate files).
